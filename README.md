# Customer Churn Prediction:

Churn prediction involves identifying which customers are inclined to terminate their subscription to a service based on their usage patterns. This holds immense significance for numerous businesses since acquiring new clients typically incurs higher costs than retaining existing ones. Once you can pinpoint customers at risk of churning, it's crucial to tailor specific marketing strategies for each customer to maximize the likelihood of retaining them.

# Why is it of paramount importance?
Customer churn is a pervasive issue across various industries. For a company to thrive, it must invest in acquiring fresh clients continually. Each time a customer departs, it signifies a substantial loss of investment, necessitating significant time and effort to replace them. The ability to foresee when a customer might leave and proactively offer incentives for them to stay can translate into substantial cost savings for a business.

# About This Project:
In our dataset, there are approximately 100,000 customers, but 49.7% of them, roughly 49779 customers, are prone to churn. Predicting which customers may churn is critical for the company since they aim to attract new customers while retaining their existing ones.

# Steps involved in Model Deployment:
1. Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Applying Machine Learning Algorithms
5. Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)
6. Saving the Model (Pickle)
7. Creating a Web Application using Flask
8. Deployment on the Web

# Packages Used:
This project relies on Python and the following essential packages:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Scipy
- Imblearn
- Counter
- Flask

# How to Run:
To execute this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset "Customer-churn-prediction.csv."
2. Open your command prompt and run the command "pip install jupyterlab" to install JupyterLab.
3. Install all the required packages listed above on your machine.
4. After downloading "myapp.py" files, run "ChurnPrediction.ipynb" on your machine.
5. Provide input data to assess our model's prediction accuracy.

# Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not, employing the Random Forest Classifier. The ultimate goal is to identify potential churners among the customer base.
