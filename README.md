# ChurnPrediction
# Customer Churn Prediction Project
# About
This project focuses on predicting customer churn based on historical customer data. Churn prediction is crucial for businesses to retain customers and reduce revenue loss. We utilized machine learning techniques to analyze customer attributes, interactions, and past churn behavior to make accurate predictions.

# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

Python 3
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Flask (for model deployment)
# Data
The dataset contains historical customer information, including attributes like age, gender, location, subscription length, monthly bill, total usage, and a churn indicator (0 or 1). It's stored in the data directory as dataset.csv.

# Project Structure
Here's an overview of the project structure:

data/: Contains the dataset.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.
src/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model building, and deployment.
requirements.txt: List of project dependencies.
# Usage
To use this project:

Explore the dataset by running the provided Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory.
Train the churn prediction model using the scripts in the src directory.
Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-time churn predictions.
These metrics indicate that our model effectively identifies customers at risk of churning.

# Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the open-source community and the contributors to the libraries and frameworks that made this project possible.
